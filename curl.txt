The problem with these cuts is that no matter how thinly you slice them, they tend to hold together quite well, which leads to the dreaded pull-out: you take one bite, and and entire slice of steak comes with you, leaving you with a piece of meat hanging awkwardly out of your mouth and three-fourths of a sandwich with nothing but condiments. To top it off, they aren't even particularly meaty or flavorful cuts. Instead, I like to turn to more substantially beefy, loosely-textured cuts like hanger, skirt, or flap meat. I happen to live a block away from a Mexican butcher that sells skirt and thinly sliced flap meat for fajitas and tortas, which makes them perfect for this sandwich.
