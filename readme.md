Grabs movies from TheMovieDatabase's API.
The goal of this project was practicing the Node/Express + React workflow, working with JSON APIs on a Node backend, and rendering the result smoothly in React. React has a lot of packages that make this really easy! 

Includes Node/Express backend responsible for doing the API requests.
Uses React for the front-end.

Also used are the following: react-router-dom is used for view routing, react-transition-group drives the animations, react-circular-progressbar is a circular progress bar ready for React use.

Requires a TheMovieDatabase API key to use.
